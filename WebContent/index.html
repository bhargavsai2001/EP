		<h1>ELECTION PROCEDURES - STUDENTS</h1><hr>
		<br>
		<p>Under the College and Institutes Act, a student is defined as:</p>

		<h2>NOMINATIONS</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Each nominee must complete an official nomination form. Each nomination must be supported by 10 eligible voters within the constituent group.</li>
			<li>Eligibility to be nominated and to cosign a nomination will be validated from an authorized voter list compiled by the Registrar.</li>
			<li>Nominations must be submitted within a specified period of time to be determined and publicized by the Registrar. Nominations received after this deadline will not be considered.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<h2>CAMPAIGN GUIDELINES</h2>

			<li>Nominees must cease campaigning and all campaign materials except the campaign platforms must be removed not less than ten hours prior to the opening of the election. The Registrar will be responsible for monitoring compliance with this regulation.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<h2>REPRESENTAION</h2>
		<p>All students who are registered in one credit course at the time of the election are eligible to vote. For the purpose of nominations, all students who are registered in one credit course at the time of the call for nomination are eligible for nomination. During the term of office, a student member of the College Board must:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>maintain registered status in at least one credit course at the College for at least two semesters of the term of office.</li>
			<li>not withdraw or be required to withdraw from the College.</li>
		</ol>

		<br>
		<a href="admin.html"><h2>BOARD</h2></a>
		<ol>
			<li>Students will elect two representatives to the Board who will serve for a term of one year and may be elected to further terms.</li>
			<li>The student representatives will be elected from the students at large.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<h2>ELECTION PROCESS</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>At the close of nominations, the Registrar will announce candidate names.</li>
			<li>Candidate campaigning and the voting process will occur over a period designated by the Registrar.</li>
			<li>Balloting procedures will ensure that only eligible voters cast a ballot and that anonymity is guaranteed for the voter. Voters must be part of the official voters list to cast a ballot.</li>
			<li>The Registrar will be responsible for the counting of ballots and the Student Union will appoint a scrutineer to validate the election results.</li>
			<li>Candidates may request a recount if the official count indicates that there is a margin of difference between the candidates of 10 votes or less.</li>
			<li>In case of a tie vote, the Registrar, in conjunction with the two candidates, will decide the outcome by a toss of the coin.</li>
			<li>Ballots submitted for the College Board elections should identify two eligible candidates. Those ballots, which identify only one candidate are deemed valid and will be counted.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<h2>ANNOUNCEMENT OF RESULTS</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The Registrar will be responsible for informing all candidates of the results.</li>
			<li>The Registrar will announce the name(s) of the successful candidates. Ballot totals will be available to candidates only.</li>

		<br>

		<br>
		<h2>APPEALS</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Any candidate is eligible to file a written request for an appeal within 10 working days of the announcement of the election results.</li>
			<li>Appeals must provide specific grounds for the appeal, indicating that due process was not followed, important evidence was missing, or the decision was inconsistent with the principles of natural justice.</li>

			<ol>
				<li>the Board Chair,</li>
				<li>the College Chief Executive Officer</li>
				<li>one Board representative</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

		<br>
		<h2>BY-ELECTIONS</h2>
